                        <p>
                        Outback Nursery is one of the largest garden centres on Vancouver Island.   Our nursery is situated on a  6 acre property and offers 5 overflowing greenhouses (30x170ft); almost 23,000 square feet.
                        Outback Nursery began in 1998-1999 when our parents retired to the island from Aldergrove. They asked if we'd be interested in joining them and then purchased this  heavily treed property. We began clearing some trees and settled into country life trying our hand at raising some turkeys and pigs as well as growing some hedging and conifers. We joined the Farmer's Market, then as our inventory expanded we began running a spec truck down island stopping here and there to show our quality product to potential customers.</p>

            <img src="images/testimonial 1.png" alt="Client">
            <p>"We have had dealings with Outback Nursery for over 16 years and because of the helpful and knowledgable staff that always greet us, that is where we went when we wanted to transform the vegetable garden into an array of shrubs and flowers when we moved into our present home 2 years ago. The quality of plants and selection is always great and the ease of access off of the Whitemud make it very convenient. The layout and cleanliness of the Nursery has always impressed us as well."</p>

            <p>"I just wanted to pass on a 'thank you' for the great customer service we received when purchasing our tree from your nursery. The girl who assisted us was very knowledgeable in helping us with our selection. The thing that really stuck out though was when she offered to hold our child giving my wife and I a moment of privacy to discuss how we wanted to proceed. We had our tree delivered and Installed, It looks great! The gentlemen who installed the tree, took time after to let us know helpful hints in taking careof it (which we also really appreciated). Thanks one last time for the positive experience."</p>

            <p>"Outback nursery is not just the place to purchace quality plants, but a source of information, encouragement and inspiration. I have been able to find many new and unusual plant here as well as the old favorites. The staff is knowledgeable, helpful, and wonderfully interested in what I am planning on doing. The display gardens are not only beautiful but are so useful in being able to see the mature plants, so when planning and planting, the future of the garden is all that more clear. Whether or not I end up taking plants home with me, I feel my time has been very well spent."</p>

            <p>"We recently moved from Vancouver to the Ships Point area to 1.5 acres of garden. Our experience with the family run Outback Nursery over the past several years has been exceptional. Their knowledge of plants combined with their very friendly and helpful service has made our experience enjoyable. Equally important is their excellent pricing, the unique and wide range of plants, shrubs, trees. They also have beautiful rich mulches and soils for the garden. We are very lucky to have found Outback Nursery, the family has helped us make our garden a success."</p>
